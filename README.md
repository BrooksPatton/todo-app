# todo-app
A web app that is meant to display what I want to work on, in the order that I want to take these tasks and projects on.

The general idea is that I want to spend as little amount of time thinking about what to do, and more on how to do it. I also want to make sure that breaks and fun are included. So the idea is that the important things will be included, and and the order that I want to do them.

This is part three of a three part todo system. Part one is the collection of ideas into an inbox. Part two is processing the inbox and preparing the list. Part three here is for displaying what to work on and marking the items as finished or not.

Deployed app can be found at [https://todo-app-c98c5.firebaseapp.com](https://todo-app-c98c5.firebaseapp.com)
